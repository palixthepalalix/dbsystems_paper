\subsection*{Processing Graph Data}


Processing graph data is not a normalized process, but most parallel systems use the following procedure\cite{blogel}.
A graph system processes a job in three stages.
The first of these phases is the locking phase. In this phase, each worker thread/process reads in vertices to main memory, then exchanges vertices with other workers so it has all of its assigned vertices.
The second phase is the iterative computing phase. In this phase, a worker processes it's vertices in sequence, in parallel with other workers. These workers operating in parallel also exchnage messages with one another.
The third phase is the dumping phase. This phase is much like a write-out in a relational DBMS. Each worker writes out the processed vertices\cite{blogel}\cite{pregel}.
